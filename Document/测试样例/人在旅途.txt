Wherever you are, and whoever you may be, there is one thing in which you and I are just alike at this moment, all in all the moments of our existence. We are not at rest; we are on a journey. Our life is a movement, a tendency, a steady, ceaseless progress towards an unseen goal. We are gaining something, or losing something, every day.

　　无论你在何处，无论你是何人，此刻，而且在我们生命的每时每刻，你与我有一点是类似的。我们不是在休息，我们在旅途中。生命是一种运动，一种趋势，一个稳步、持续的通往一个未知目标的过程。每天，我们都在获得，或失去。

　　Even when our position and our character seem to remain precisely the same, they are changing, for the mere advance of time is a change. It is not the same thing to have a bare field in January and in July. The season makes the difference. The limitations that are childlike in the child are childish in the man.

　　尽管我们的地位和性格看起来好像一点都没变，但是它们在变化。因为时光的流逝本身是一种变化。在一月和七月拥有一片贫瘠的土地是不同的，是季节本身带来了变化。孩童时可爱的缺点到了成人时便成了幼稚。

　　Everything that we do is a step in one direction or another. Even the failure to do something is in itself a deed. It sets us forward or backward. The action of the negative pole of a magnetic needle is just as real as the action of the positive pole. To decline is to accept the other alternative. .

　　我们做的每件事都是迈向一个或另外一个方向，甚至“什么都没做”本身也是一种行为，它让我们前进或倒退。一棵磁针的阴极的作用与阳极是一样的。拒绝即接受其反面。

　　Are you nearer to your port today than you were yesterday? Yes, you must be a little nearer to some port or other; for since your ship was launched upon the sea of life, you have never been still for a single moment - the sea is too deep; you could not find an anchorage if you would; there can be no pause until you come into port.

　　你今天比昨天更加接近你的目标了吗?是的，你肯定是离一个或另一个码头或更近一些了。因为自从你的小船从生命的海洋上起航时，你没有哪一刻是停止的。大海是这样深，你想抛锚时找不到地方。在你驶入码头之前，你不可能停留。
